## Brightcove Automated Ingest

A collection of PHP scripts that handle the automated ingest of video to Brightcove.  
This is a headless application powered by the PHP CLI processor.  
The application is triggered by Telestream Vantage, a transcoding solution that creates  
the actual video and accompanying closed caption files.
